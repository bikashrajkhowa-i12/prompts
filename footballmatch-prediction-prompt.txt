FORGET ALL PRIOR ASSUMPTIONS, PRESETS, OR POPULAR PICKS.  
For the match **"[Team A] vs [Team B]" on [Date]**, ignore manipulated, biased, or overly common predictions.  

Focus entirely on **objective analysis** through deep research into the following:

KEY FACTORS TO CONSIDER:
- Recent form  
- Head-to-head stats  
- Injuries and suspensions  
- Team news and expected lineups  
- Home/away performance  
- Managerial tactics and philosophy  
- Opponent strength and playing style  
- Match importance and table context  
- Momentum, fatigue, and motivation
- Climate factors
- Randomness, human factors, and situational context   
- Scoreline behavior (whether a team tends to defend or attack after leading)  

Use both **data analysis** and **tactical insight** to predict the most probable outcome.

YOUR OUTPUT MUST INCLUDE:
1. *1x2* (high-probability, not speculative)  
2. Prediction for **Over/Under [2.5 or relevant line]**, with reasoning  
3. **BTTS (Both Teams To Score): Yes or No**  
4. **Injury suspensions ≥ 0.2 xG swing.**
5. **Suggest unit size (1 u = 1 % roll).**

If this match shows **extreme volatility or unpredictable variance or second‑string line‑ups**, **skip it** and explain why.
