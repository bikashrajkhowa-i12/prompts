   - Exploits vs high press  
   - Set-pieces, counters, or overperforming xG

2. Overrated Defense Metrics  
   - Missing key defender disrupts shape  
   - Data lag behind current form

3. Game-State Chaos (Red Cards, Early Goals)  
   - Early events distort plans  
   - Momentum swings = prediction disruption

4. Mental & Momentum Factors  
   - Pressure kills flow  
   - Underdogs play with freedom  
   - Home crowd expectation becomes weight

### 🧠 Lessons for Smarter Predictions

1. Form ≠ Just Results — finishing quality matters  
2. Analyze team response to conceding first  
3. Adjust for *specific* defensive absences  
4. Game-state chaos should be factored in pre-match  
5. Strength on set pieces = undervalued xG edge  
6. Motivation and pressure matter — not always visible in stats  
7. Sharp line moves need tactical verification
