2. Weigh how teams react under pressure  
3. One key absence can distort an entire model  
4. BTTS thrives in chaos, not just stats  
5. Public perception skews market, especially on BTTS/Overs  
6. Watch set-piece trends — often ignored by market  
7. Adjust for venue bias & referee style  
8. Be alert to misleading line moves without context
